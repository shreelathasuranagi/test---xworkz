SQL:

-- 1. write the command to create a new table with 5 columns

CREATE TABLE employees (int employee_id, employee_name varchar(20), department varchar(20), int salary, int no_of_years);

-- 2. write the command to insert 5 rows of data in the table

INSERT INTO employees VALUES 
(1, "Jeremy", "IT", 4000000, 2),
(2, "Landon", "Marketing", 3000000, 1),
(3, "Killian", "Medical", 4000000, 3),
(4, "Creighton", "Sales", 2000000, 2),
(5, "Eli", "Business", 7000000, 4);

-- 3. What are constraints? How many constraints are there? Explain each with example

Constraints refers to the rules given for inserting data into the columns of a table.

The following are the different constraints in SQL:

Primary Key:

Eg: CREATE TABLE tab1(int val1 PRIMARY KEY, val2 varchar(30), val3 varchar(30), date date);

Foreign Key:


-- 4. Explain group by and having with examples
Group by is used to combine the tables based on  column condition.

Eg:

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 25 GROUP BY department;

HAVING:

SELECT * FROM anime WHERE animation_house = "TOEI" GROUP BY year
HAVING viewers > 200000;

-- 5. Write a command to add a column to the existing table

ALTER TABLE tab1(col1, col2, col3, col4)
ADD COLUMN(col5, col6);

--6. Write a command to drop a column in the existing table

DROP COLUMN column_name;

-- 7. Write a command to rename a column in the existing table

ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN col_nameTO new_col_name;


--8. Write a command to change a column name in the existing table

ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN col_name TO new_col_name;
